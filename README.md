# SS20_Project_Management
Team : Jasmin , Bastian , Jennifer , Patrick

# Goals
Our main goals for this project are : 
  * to build a GUI application
  * that can be run on a raspberry pi 3 b+
  * which is relatively easy to use
  * and is able to store and display data from commercial car rides

# Commit Rules
 * a commit should be one relatively small logical unit as it needs to be reversible at any time
 * write commit messages in the present tense imperative ("add file..." and not "added file...")
 * all commit messages are written in english
 * use the following commit tags : 
      * [init] when you add a new module to the repository ("[init] create file 'whatever.py'")  
      * [impl] when you implement a new feature ("[impl] add this or that functionality")
      * [fix] when you fix a bug ("[fix] fix bug that caused *whatever* problem")
      * [doc] when you add, remove or fix documentation ("[doc] add team description to documentation")
      * [tidy] when you make small non code changes such as removing whitespaces ("[tidy] remove trailing spaces")
      * [comment] when you add, edit or remove a comment ("[comment] add ... comment")
	  * [chore] when you add, edit or remove config files like .gitignore ("[chore] add .gitignore")

# Coding Conventions
all the conventions below apply only to handwriten code and not to generated code

  * try to create only one class per file in order to prevent chaos
  * put at least one blank line between class and function definitions 
  * always try to make your code as readable as possible
  * all class attributes get the prefix "m_" followed by a lowercase name ("m_*attributename*")
  * class names start with capital letters ("class Example :")
  * don't write endlessly long lines of code (rule of thumb : if you have to use the scroll bar then it 's bad)
